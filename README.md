# Image Classification Projects

This repository contains three image classification projects utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Projects

### 1. CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project aims to solve an image classification problem using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The project employs TensorFlow and Keras to develop a CNN model that is trained on the CIFAR-10 training data and evaluated on the test data.

### Key Features

- Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model building
- Implements a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers
- Achieves approximately 72% accuracy on the test set

### 2. Malaria Cell Detection

This project focuses on detecting malaria-infected cells using a CNN model. The dataset contains 27,558 images categorized into "Infected" and "Uninfected" classes. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

### Key Features

- Uses TensorFlow and Keras for model building
- Applies data augmentation techniques for improved model robustness
- Achieves high accuracy in detecting malaria-infected cells

### 3. Skin Cancer Detection

This project classifies skin images as cancerous or non-cancerous using a CNN model. It uses labeled images of skin conditions and predicts whether a given skin image is cancerous or not. The project also includes a web app deployed using Streamlit.

### Key Features

- Uses TensorFlow and Keras to build the model
- Includes a Streamlit web app, [accessible here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/metehanayhan/Skin-Cancer-Model)
- Achieves high accuracy in detecting cancerous skin images

## Results

The results for all projects include accuracy metrics and loss values. Training and validation accuracy and loss plots are provided.
