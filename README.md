# Image Classification Projects

This repository contains two image classification projects utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 

## Projects

### 1. CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project aims to solve an image classification problem using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The project employs TensorFlow and Keras to develop a CNN model that is trained on the CIFAR-10 training data and evaluated on the test data.

#### Key Features
- Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model building
- Implements a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers
- Achieves approximately 72% accuracy on the test set


### 2. Malaria Cell Detection

This project focuses on detecting malaria-infected cells using a CNN model. The dataset contains 27,558 images categorized into "Infected" and "Uninfected" classes. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

#### Key Features
- Uses TensorFlow and Keras for model building
- Applies data augmentation techniques for improved model robustness
- Achieves high accuracy in detecting malaria-infected cells

### Results
Results
The results for both projects include accuracy metrics and loss values. Plots of training and validation accuracy and loss are also provided for the Malaria project.
